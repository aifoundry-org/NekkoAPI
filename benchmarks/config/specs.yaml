      Summarize the following excerpt from *War and Peace* by Leo Tolstoy in **no more than 300 words**. 
      Focus on the main events, characters, and tone. Avoid personal opinions or interpretations.

      [BEGIN EXCERPT]
      “Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, 
      if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing 
      more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have 
      frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.”

      It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor to the Empress Marya Fëdorovna. With these 
      words she greeted Prince Vassily, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her soirée. Anna Pavlovna had been 
      coughing for several days; she had a grippe, and having arranged a gathering of selected people, she seemed eager to put forth all her 
      energies despite her illness.

      Prince Vassily had been taking his seat near her, leaning his heavily-laced, gloved hand on the table, when she interrupted him.

      “If you can’t see the difference between the Emperor and the Emperor Napoleon, I can have no more argument with you. You are my best friend, 
      but if you remain on Napoleon’s side, I shall cease to regard you as such. Now, sit down and tell me about your family.”

      The prince bent over Anna Pavlovna’s hand, kissed it, and sat down. “First of all, dear friend,” said he, “tell me how you are. Set your 
      friend’s mind at rest; how can you be well when you have a grippe? You are suffering—well, get it over as quickly as you can!”
